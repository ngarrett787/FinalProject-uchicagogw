This repository contains all the information for the UChicago Fall 2018 GW Seminar Series.  The .ipynb files contain my code used. 
It is based heavily on the code from calculating evidences in lecture6 from the uchicago-gw repository. All of the extraneous files are
the dependencies for the code (the various EOS files and the data file for GW170817).
